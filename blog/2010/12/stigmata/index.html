<p>In order to reply, I&#8217;m going to include a short biased history for some
context.</p>

<p>Many moons ago, Adobe kicked up a large fuss when they saw that they were
unable to exploit a particularly lucrative<sup id="refBody1"><a href="#refAnchor1">1</a></sup> new platform (iOS/iPhone/iJobs),
leading them to trade lies and half truths around user freedoms in both blogs
and the mainstream press. This provoked an uproar which, unfortunately for
Adobe, caused many people to start looking at Flash and critically evaluate
Adobe&#8217;s closed tools and platform against the native tools (closed and open)
and other alternatives.</p>

<p>The fallout is ongoing, as can be seen from the article Christopher mentions.</p>

<p>The people who are most likely to be aware of Flash on a platform, I think,
are also those likely to be more technically au fait with the ins and outs of
development, or at least techy geek types. Neither class of people are
particularly renowned for enjoying bloated middleware, and that&#8217;s led to (at
times unfairly harsh) criticism of Flash and it&#8217;s uses on phones, tablets,
netbooks and so forth.</p>

<p>That will all blow over - most people don&#8217;t care how many layers there are
between the thing they are looking at on screen and the instructions running
on a CPU. They want the pretty colours or simulated flatulence generator
buttons.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Adobe, Flash content is often noticeably worse on highly
portable devices. Users <em>do</em> notice that. Degrading someone&#8217;s expected
experience is a cardinal sin, and a sin that is hard to forget. A couple of
those and you are consigned to the &#8220;this is shit and doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; bin from
which it can take years to escape. Ask Javascript: it&#8217;s had over a decade in
that wilderness, and is only now being welcomed home.</p>

<p>Adobe has exacerbated the situation by breathlessly exclaiming to users (and
sometimes to developers/designers) that you&#8217;ll have a desktop Flash experience
everywhere. But then users see the jerky scrolling on pages laden with
adverts, their battery life vanishing, bothersome control mechanisms, or games
that don&#8217;t have any of the 3D slickness of a natively developed application.</p>

<p>At that point it&#8217;s partly the developer&#8217;s fault - but consumers see Flash as
the issue, because that&#8217;s the brand which has been sold to them. Adobe looks,
to them, as if they are another company peddling the usual lies (&#8220;yes, this
version of the OS will run faster than ever before!&#8221;).</p>

<p>So, that covers my answer to the first question - in many cases the criticism
is justified. Caught out by their own mis-truths.</p>

<p>How do they fix it? My answer to that one is: stop lying. Admit where the
strengths and weaknesses are to everyone. Stop being so seemingly emotionally
attached to Flash as a hammer for every solution. Although I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see
that emotional attachment flip as soon as they have a viable, and priced,
alternative for generating HTML versions of Flash content.</p>

<p>Open source the Flash player - allow developers to improve your codebase,
allow them to take what they want from it and remould it into something
wonderful. Hell, let someone take the vector engine and add the good parts to
the SVG spec and add the nice bitmap manipulations to the HTML 5 canvas spec.
Make it a permissive licence like <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, I feel its too late for that. There&#8217;s a momentum behind the changes
coming for HTML - nothing like a good old implementation war to drive the
fires of innovation. That&#8217;s something that Flash in its current form cannot
have. The rate of useful additions to HTML has been astounding recently - far
faster than the additions to Flash. Flash is being tweaked, HTML is innovating
and adding new developer demanded features. For architecting a product, open
source can be nothing short of miraculous. Flash is mired in its closed legacy.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Yes the criticism is justified, open source the player to attempt to fix it.</p>

<li id="refAnchor1">
<p>Adobe&#8217;s true concerns were over the indirect revenues they stood to lose if people no longer used their Flash development tools for content on iOS, whether that was as an application or as content served in a web page. For comparison, how many set top boxes have Adobe lambasted for not allowing their player on the platform? How about XBox 360 applications? Televisions? LG phones? Samsung phones without Symbian?  
Adobe want to make money. It&#8217;s what companies do. Most of them aren&#8217;t silly
enough to claim that their real intentions are selfless desires for user
freedom. That sort of argument is generally reserved for misuse by
governments, often while they&#8217;re shooting at you. It&#8217;s for your own good you
see, now just put that stone down and let nice Mr. Tank through.
<p>I digress somewhat&#8230;
