    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elements_of_a_tampon_with_applicator.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/whisky_tampon.png" width="200" height="130"></a></p>

<p>So I've been thinking about this, and pending further evidence I'm going to
assume that the story about vodka soaked tampons (see
<a href="http://goo.gl/7bpv3">KPHO</a>) is rubbish. Every so often it seems to make the
rounds (see <a href="http://goo.gl/2u9Oe">Snopes</a>). Here's why I'm an unbeliever.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>A tampon will soak up about 15ml-18ml (see <a href="http://goo.gl/jSCOQ">About.com</a>)
of liquid which is a pathetic dram. Alcohol is not blood, but for this thought
experiment it'll do. I can test it later. Regardless, it's likely much less
than a shot.</p>

<p>In addition tampons are designed to retain liquid rather than release it, so
there's a reasonable chance that it wouldn't release the booze very quickly.</p>

<p>Now, as far as I can discover, a stomach absorbs about 20% of consumed alcohol
(see <a href="http://goo.gl/kqc7C">Brown University</a>), the rest is through your
intestine. For the moment I'll make the assumption that vaginal walls absorb
alcohol at a similar rate as the intestine. Although this probably isn't
accurate due to the the quantity of blood vessels, it doesn't matter because
the rumour generally also includes men who, it is whispered, stick it up their
bum.</p>

<p>It follows, I think, that if I drink a Polite Dram (about 35ml - 40ml), 80% of
that will end up in my intestines, which is 28ml - 32ml. That's about double
what this mythical Tampon Delivery Mechanism would offer. Also, drinking the
Polite Dram on an empty stomach (remember kids: eatin' is cheatin') will whap
that Double Tampon Quantity right into my intestine, an organ which exists to
diffuse things into my blood vessels and make embarassing noises during quiet
moments.</p>

<p>Therefore I conclude that ingesting a Polite Dram on an empty stomach may be
up to twice as efficacious as Tampon Delivery, plus it's easier to buy in
rounds. Have you ever tried getting a tampon in a pub? Those bloody machines
never work.</p>

<p>Right, pending volunteers for double blind tests, I'll get back to my coding
with a nice <a href="http://www.thebalvenie.com/en-%0Agb/ourRange_currentRange_signature.php">Balvenie Doublewood</a>. In a

    <updated>2011-08-11T17:11:00+01:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blues_shuffle_in_E.png"><img class="right" src="/images/thumb1.png" width="200" height="130"></a></p>

<p>For some reason, there doesn't seem to be any sane example of shuffling
arrays in ActionScript blogland. I discovered this when I was trying to send
a lazy link to someone of an implementation rather than write the code
myself. Oh, by sane I mean vaguely efficient, not overusing crazy Math.floor
or Array.slice functions.</p>

<p>Shuffling data isn't a new problem, but people seem to always want to re-
invent things. Alas, it's often re-invented poorly. Here's a nice vintage
shuffling algorithm for you from 1964 (although the idea is based on a method
from 1938. History rocks.). Example usage is in the huge header comment:</p>

<p>Feel free to extend the class to support typed Vectors. Sadly, you have to
implement each Vector type yourself as AS3 currently has no non-hacky method
of implementing template functions.</p>

<p>Well, what a pleasant hiatus that was. Almost 3 months. However, no more! I
shall get back to blogging random useless technical details about various
things. I know you missed me really.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So, what's happening next? Well, firstly, I'm temporarily turning to the Dark
Side and getting a Nexus One. This shiny new toy should be in my sweaty paws
within the week. I'm thoroughly looking forward to breaking it. I may even try
some Flash programming on it, although I'm far more interested in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html">Android NDK</a> at the moment. Since I
have no creative bones, I want to see how well it lends itself to running
<a href="http://www.box2d.org/">Box2D</a> (I know it's already been ported to NDK, but
what's the point of Open Source if you can't rewrite the wheel every couple of
weeks?).</p>

<p>After that, I may actually get around to finishing the shabby little
accelerated computation engine thingy I was writing for
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pixelbender/">PixelBender</a> and
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/">Flash</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe by mentioning these things somewhere, I'll actually get around to
finishing them…</p>

<p>Firstly, however, I'll have to tinker with Eclipse. I really don't like white
backgrounds and black text in a code editor. Plus, I like procrastinating and
putting off actual productive work.</p>

<p>While you are waiting for all those terribly exciting projects to appear, why
not go an learn guitar? You'll have time. Try
<a href="http://justinguitar.com/">http://justinguitar.com/</a> for nice course.</p>
