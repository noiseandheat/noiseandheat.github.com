<p>Well, what a pleasant hiatus that was. Almost 3 months. However, no more! I
shall get back to blogging random useless technical details about various
things. I know you missed me really.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So, what's happening next? Well, firstly, I'm temporarily turning to the Dark
Side and getting a Nexus One. This shiny new toy should be in my sweaty paws
within the week. I'm thoroughly looking forward to breaking it. I may even try
some Flash programming on it, although I'm far more interested in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html">Android NDK</a> at the moment. Since I
have no creative bones, I want to see how well it lends itself to running
<a href="http://www.box2d.org/">Box2D</a> (I know it's already been ported to NDK, but
what's the point of Open Source if you can't rewrite the wheel every couple of
weeks?).</p>

<p>After that, I may actually get around to finishing the shabby little
accelerated computation engine thingy I was writing for
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pixelbender/">PixelBender</a> and
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/">Flash</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe by mentioning these things somewhere, I'll actually get around to
finishing themâ€¦</p>

<p>Firstly, however, I'll have to tinker with Eclipse. I really don't like white
backgrounds and black text in a code editor. Plus, I like procrastinating and
putting off actual productive work.</p>

<p>While you are waiting for all those terribly exciting projects to appear, why
not go an learn guitar? You'll have time. Try
