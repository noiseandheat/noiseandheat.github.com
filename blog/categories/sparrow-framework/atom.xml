<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://gamua.com/blog/2012/03/sparrow-1-3/">Sparrow 1.3</a> has now
been released and it includes an updated and significantly enhanced
AppScaffold project which makes most of the reasons to use SparrowBones
redundant. I recommend you use the official AppScaffold project as a starting
point now, rather than SparrowBones.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://www.sparrow-framework.org/">Sparrow-Framework</a> is pretty awesome for
quickly chucking together iOS games. But wouldn't it be nicer if there was a
handy Xcode 4 template to start from?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Your wish is my command! Presenting <strong>SparrowBones</strong>, a beautiful handcrafted
Xcode 4 template:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mnem/SparrowBones">https://github.com/mnem/SparrowBones</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It's fairly simple and slightly hacky. Unlike the AppScaffold, which comes
with Sparrow-Framework, it supports automatic rotation (because I always hold
my iPhone the wrong way) and unit testing (because I'm crazy like that). The
<a href="https://github.com/mnem/SparrowBones/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file
in the project should guide you through the installation.</p>

<p>If you use it, you'll notice 2 template projects in the SparrowBones section -
<em>"Game with Sparrow source copied"</em> and <em>"Game with Sparrow source linked"</em>.
The only difference between them is that with the copied source the Sparrow
Framework source code is copied into your new project. If you choose linked,
the Sparrow Framework source is connected to your new project through your
<code>SPARROW_SRC</code> variable in Xcode.</p>

<p>Why 2 templates? Mainly because the Xcode template format is undocumented and
I haven't quite worked out how to include a linked project easily in a
template. This means that you have to tweak a few things when you use a linked
project unfortunately. But never fear! This post has a handy guide to getting
it working a little further down.</p>

<p>Although it's recommended that you use the template with the linked Sparrow
source (because it's a lot easier to update Sparrow-Framework that way), you
may actually want to have a project with the Sparrow source copied. For
example, if you are doing some hardcore hacking of the source this is a good
option, or if you want to create a self contained project you can archive and
mail to people it's great for that too.</p>

<p>On with the guide!</p>

<h2>Setting up linked source SparrowBones projects</h2>

<p>Choose the right one:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/00_sb_choose.png" width="730" height="493"></p>

<p>Fill in some blanks and choose which device family to aim for. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>:
Uncheck "Use Automatic Reference Counting" (Sparrow doesn't work with that
yet). I also uncheck "Use Storyboard" because I haven't learned how to use
those:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/01_sb_name_stuff.png" width="730" height="493"></p>

<p>Next, we have to fix that red Sparrow.xcodeproj reference. Select it and press
Alt-Cmd-1 to show the inspector:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/02_sb_select_sparrow.png" width="859" height="321"></p>

<p>Then change it to be relative to your linked Sparrow Framework source.
<strong>NOTE</strong>: the link name may be different for you – it depends on what you
entered when setting it up (if you haven't set a link to the source up, <a href="http://www.sparrow-framework.org/help/gettingstarted/">do that now</a> before
continuing):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/03_sb_adjust_link.png" width="260" height="228"></p>

<p>If you look back at the Project navigator you should see Sparrow.xcodeproj as
an <strong>expandable</strong> project:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/04_sb_linked_properly.png" width="260" height="64"></p>

<p>This is <strong>important</strong>. If it doesn't have the arrow, you will have to <strong>quit</strong>
Xcode and then re-launch it and open the project. Sometimes Xcode is a bit
slow about picking up path changes.</p>

<p>If that all important triangle is next to Sparrow.xcodeproj, you have one more
thing to do. Xcode needs to know that it has to build Sparrow.xcodeproj as a
dependency of your game target. Here's how: <strong>1)</strong> Select Sparrow.xcodeproj in
the project navigator, <strong>2)</strong> select your game target in the editor window,
<strong>3)</strong> go to the Build Phases section, <strong>4)</strong> expand the target dependencies
and click the plus.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/05_sb_add_dep.png" width="817" height="275"></p>

<p>In the window that appears, select the Sparrow target:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/06_sb_choos_dep.png" width="402" height="462"></p>

<p>Select Add. If my instructions worked, you should now have Sparrow as a
dependency:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/07_sb_dep_added.png" width="591" height="159"></p>

<p>That's it! Simple once you know how. You should now be able to run the project
in one of the simulator targets and you will some see Exciting Boxes on the
screen. Awesome. Well done you!</p>

<h2>A Note on Unit Tests</h2>

<p>If you want to write unit tests, and I know you do, you will have to add all
the Frameworks in the frameworks folder to your <code>&lt;AppName&gt;Tests</code> target,
otherwise you will get lots of Mach-O linker errors:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/0_article_thumb31.png" width="200" height="130"></p>

<p>Another one of my silly mistakes. I've been having problems getting fonts
I was using in game (created with the rather excellent <a href="http://glyphdesigner.71squared.com/">Glyph Designer</a>)
to display as anything other than a black blobby mess.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Since we're living in the wonderful world of open source software here, I
tracked down the issue to the color being applied to each character. I eagerly
knocked up a quick pull request to make the application of color optional.</p>

<p>It turns out none of that was needed. Simply set the color to white and
everything is hunky dory:</p>

    <link href="http://noiseandheat.github.com/blog/2011/07/sparrow-framework-appscaffold-not-archiving-correctly-fix/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-09T01:49:00+01:00</updated>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: <em>The pull request was merged, so this should be all fixed.</em></p>

<p>If you've tried to create an app using the latest <a href="http://www.sparrow-framework.org/">Sparrow Framework</a>
and XCode 4, then tried to Archive it (say for distributing via the excellent
<a href="https://testflightapp.com/">TestFlightApp</a> service), you may have run into an
error similar to the following:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>AppScaffold Cannot be Validated “AppScaffold” does not contain a single–bundle application or contains multiple products. Please select another archive, or adjust your scheme to create a single–bundle application.</p></blockquote></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Don't panic! This solution is simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>In XCode, select the linked Sparrow project.</li>
<li>In the editor, select the Sparrow target.</li>
<li>Now select the "Build Phases" tab.</li>
<li><p>Expand the "Copy Headers" section. It should look a little like this:</p>

<p> <img class="center" src="/images/post_screenshot_011.png" width="800" height="200"></p></li>
<li><p>Now select all the header files in the "Public" section and drag them to "Project". You should end up with the section looking like this:</p>

<p> <img class="center" src="/images/post_screenshot_11.png" width="444" height="351"></p></li>
</ol>


<p>That should be all you need to do. Now if you Archive the app, you should be
able to successfully Share/Validate it from the Archive Organizer, and your
icons and version numbers should look as delicious as you expected.</p>

<p>I've submitted a <a href="https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Sparrow-Framework/pull/1032">pull request</a>,
so assuming I haven't done anything too insane in it,
these changes should make it into the main project at some point.</p>

    <link href="http://noiseandheat.github.com/blog/2011/07/simple-clipped-image-for-sparrow-framework/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-06T23:52:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://noiseandheat.github.com/blog/2011/07/simple-clipped-image-for-sparrow-framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/mnem/SXSimpleClippedImage/"><img class="right" src="/images/0_article_thumb5.png" width="200" height="130"></a></p>

<p>I'm currently playing around with the rather fine iOS game engine,
<a href="http://www.sparrow-framework.org/">Sparrow Framework</a>.</p>

<p>I had been aware of it for a while, but hadn't really got my hands dirty using
it. However I've recently resolved to work on a few side projects with <a href="https://twitter.com/dwlt">Dave Thomson</a> who waxed lyrical about it's ease of use,
so I decided to learn a bit more about it.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It's great. No, really, it is. It's fairly lightweight, but quite powerful -
it uses a display model similar to Flash so anyone who has coded in AS3 will
immediately feel at home. I'm looking forward to mastering it, and I suspect
I'll be writing a few posts about using it in the games I'm working on.</p>

<p>However, the lightweightness does mean that sometimes simple features you want
to use aren't there. That's not a problem though - it has a small but vibrant
developer community, and the main website encourages people to add extensions
to it. These are essentially classes or simple modifications posted as
<a href="http://gist.github.com/">gists</a>, or sometimes provided as full
<a href="http://github.com/">github</a> repositories, which are all linked to from the
<a href="http://wiki.sparrow-framework.org/extensions/start">extensions</a> section in
the Sparrow wiki. You just grab the files and add them to your own project.</p>

<p>So, here is my first extension:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mnem/SXSimpleClippedImage/tree/master/Classes">https://github.com/mnem/SXSimpleClippedImage/tree/master/Classes</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It's a simple extension to the <a href="http://doc.sparrow-framework.org/core/Classes/SPImage.html">SPImage</a>
class so that you can display only a sub-region of the image texture associated
with the <a href="http://doc.sparrow-framework.org/core/Classes/SPImage.html">SPImage</a>.
If you've used Flash, you can think of it as a rectangular mask for the image data.
The main difference is that as you move the mask from <code>0,0</code> in the
<a href="http://doc.sparrow-framework.org/core/Classes/SPImage.html">SPImage</a>,
the remaining image data is drawn starting at the current location of the
<a href="http://doc.sparrow-framework.org/core/Classes/SPImage.html">SPImage</a>
object on the screen. That probably makes no sense, but if you play with it,
you'll see what I mean. There's a reasonable chance that behaviour will
sufficiently annoy me in the near future that I'll fix it.</p>

<p>For an example on how to use it, clone or browse the project repository and
have a look in <a href="https://github.com/mnem/SXSimpleClippedImage/blob/master/TestClasses/Game.m">TestClasses/game.m</a>.</p>
