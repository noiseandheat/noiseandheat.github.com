<p>Experiencing <code>clang</code> failing with no other error information?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>If so, then check the scheme name you are building. If it has a space in it,
that's probably the issue. This had me tearing my hair out for about an hour.</p>

<p>If you run the full command which Xcode is using, you can see in a terminal
what's causing the failure:</p>

<pre><code>$ export IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=4.3
$ export PATH="/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin:/Developer/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
$ /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/clang -arch armv7 -isysroot /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS5.0.sdk "-L/Users/mnem/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Cartouche-gptqetvxyitumqejkandgswxgqob/ArchiveIntermediates/NAH Distribution/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos" -L/Users/mnem/Developer/github/private/Cartouche/ios/Cartouche/../third_party/Flurry -L/Users/mnem/Developer/github/private/Cartouche/ios/Cartouche/../third_party/TestFlightSDK "-F/Users/mnem/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Cartouche-gptqetvxyitumqejkandgswxgqob/ArchiveIntermediates/NAH Distribution/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos" -filelist "/Users/mnem/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Cartouche-gptqetvxyitumqejkandgswxgqob/ArchiveIntermediates/NAH Distribution/IntermediateBuildFilesPath/Cartouche.build/Release-iphoneos/Matching Set TestFlight.build/Objects-normal/armv7/Matching Set TF.LinkFileList" -dead_strip /Users/mnem/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Cartouche-gptqetvxyitumqejkandgswxgqob/ArchiveIntermediates/NAH Distribution/BuildProductsPath/Release-iphoneos/libSparrow.a -ObjC -all_load -lz -fobjc-arc -miphoneos-version-min=4.3 -framework Twitter -framework Accounts -framework MessageUI -framework UIKit -framework Foundation -framework CoreGraphics -framework AudioToolbox -framework AVFoundation -framework OpenAL -framework OpenGLES -framework QuartzCore -lFlurryAnalytics -lTestFlight -o "/Users/mnem/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Cartouche-gptqetvxyitumqejkandgswxgqob/ArchiveIntermediates/NAH Distribution/InstallationBuildProductsLocation/Applications/Matching Set TF.app/Matching Set TF"

You can see fairly clearly that <code>clang</code> is failing to find a directory because
of the space in the scheme name, "<strong>NAH Distribution</strong>". If you dig through
the command text, it appears that Xcode doesn't use quotes for the library
passed to the <code>-dead_strip</code> command. This may be peculiar to projects with
sub-projects.</p>

<p>Whitespace problems in 3178. Oh dear.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>K&amp;R. Allman. BSD. Crazy Whitesmiths. No, it's not a nu-punk-alt-country rock
band, but a selection of common (well, sort of) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style">code indent styles</a>.
Much blood has been spilled arguing over the merits of each.</p>

<p>I'm not brave enough to venture into that battlefield, but I can at least
point the weary foot soldier towards the tent of General <a href="http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/">Uncrustify</a> and
his Marvellous Xcode Contraption.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Xcode Scripting</h2>

<p>Previous versions of Xcode allowed fairly powerful scripting. Sadly that
feature has gone. It has been replaced by <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#recipes/xcode_help-alerts_preferences/Recipe.html">Behaviors</a>
instead. While they aren't quite as flexible, they can be used to run a shell
script from wherever your project has been saved.</p>

<p>First download the wrapper script I created for <code>uncrustify</code>. You can either
save the script from your browser by visiting the
<a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/1641451/nah_xcode_uncrustify.rb">gist page</a>, or you can clone the gist with <code>git</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://gist.github.com/1641451.git nah_xcode_uncrustify
</code></pre>

<p>If you download the script from your browser, don't forget to make it
executable:</p>

<pre><code>$ chmod a+x nah_xcode_uncrustify.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Have a quick look over the script to make sure I'm not doing anything evil,
like tarring all your source and emailing it to my swiss github account. Next,
make sure you have <code>uncrustify</code> installed. If you have the nifty package
manager <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>, then installing is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install uncrustify
</code></pre>

<p>If you have another package manager installed such as <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, then you
can probably use that to install <code>uncrustify</code>. Otherwise you'll have to build it from
source and put the executable in your <code>/usr/bin</code> folder. See
<a href="https://github.com/bengardner/uncrustify">https://github.com/bengardner/uncrustify</a> for more
details.</p>

<p>Now add a new Behavior to Xcode. From the Xcode menu, select
"<strong>Edit Behaviors…</strong>":</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/uncrustify_select_behaviors.png" width="432" height="250"></p>

<p>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon in the list to add a new Behavior, give it a name and
scroll to the "<strong>Run</strong>" script check box. Tick the check box and then select
"<strong>Choose script…</strong>" from the drop down list next to it:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/uncrustify_select_script.png" width="750" height="528"></p>

<p>Navigate to wherever you have the <code>nah_xcode_uncrustify.rb</code> script and select
it.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to the Behavior by double
clicking on the command symbol next to the Behavior name. In the screen above
I've assigned <em>alt-shift-f</em> to the Behavior.</p>

<p>Now for a test run. Open an Objective-C project. <strong>Make sure you have it
safely under version control</strong>. This is <em>very</em> important because <code>uncrustify</code>
has been set to run without creating a backup of the source files. If you
don't have your source under version control and you hate what it does to your
files, then there's no going back.</p>

<p>Save all the open files by pressing <em>alt-command-s</em> (the script modifies the
files on disk, you need to save first) and be sure to stage any new source
file changes or whatever the equivalent is in the VCS you are using. Now run
<code>uncrustify</code> either by selecting the Behavior you just created from the
Behaviors menu, or using the keyboard shortcut you assigned.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of the project it may take a few moments to run. When
it's finished, you should see that the source controlled files are marked as
modified and any open ones should reload with nice uncrusted spacing.</p>

<p>If you're really eager to have formatted code, you can edit the "<strong>Build
starts</strong>" Behavior in Xcode and tell it to run <code>nah_xcode_uncrustify.rb</code> before
each build.</p>

<h2>I Hate Your Uncrusting Config, How Do I Fix It?</h2>

<p>The first time the script is run, it creates a file called
<code>.nah_xcode_uncrustify.cfg</code> in your home folder. To change or tweak how
<code>nah_xcode_uncrustify.rb</code> tells <code>uncrustify</code> to format your source, simply
edit that config file.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the config file starts with a <code>.</code> indicating it is hidden, so by
default Finder won't show it. You can either open it from Terminal or else set
Finder to show hidden files (<a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5870/how-to-show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-finder">how to</a>).</p>

<p>The config file is fairly well documented. If it all goes hideously wrong
during editing, you can always delete <code>.nah_xcode_uncrustify.cfg</code> from your
home folder then re-reun the uncrustifying Behavior. A new default config
file will be generated.</p>

<h2>UniversalIndentGUI</h2>

<p>If tweaking text config files isn't your thing, you can use a great utility
called <a href="http://universalindent.sourceforge.net/">UniversalIndentGUI</a> to modify the config file. It allows you to play with
values and preview the changes on the currently loaded source file.</p>

<p>To use it, simply download the OS X version from the <a href="http://universalindent.sourceforge.net/">UniversalIndentGUI</a>
homepage, chuck it in your Applications folder, and then when you run it,
select <code>uncrustify</code> as the code formatter:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/uncrustify_uig.png" width="285" height="193"></p>

<p>You can use the "<strong>Live Indent Preview</strong>" check box to toggle between the
original file and the settings you've selected.</p>

<p>If you want to use the default config from the script as a starting point, you
have to tell <code>uncrustify</code> to modify it a bit first. The following command
should do the trick:</p>

<pre><code>$ uncrustify -c ~/.nah_xcode_uncrustify.cfg --universalindent &gt; \
    ~/uigui_nah_xcode_uncrustify.ini
</code></pre>

<p>That will create or <strong>overwrite</strong> a file in your home directory called
<code>uigui_nah_xcode_uncrustify.ini</code>. Import that into <a href="http://universalindent.sourceforge.net/">UniversalIndentGUI</a> and
fiddle with it as much as you want.</p>

<p>Whether you start from scratch or tweak the default config created by the
script, you will have to save it to your home folder as a file called
<code>.nah_xcode_uncrustify.cfg</code>. When you do, the app will ask you if you want to
save a file starting with <code>.</code> (you do) and if you want to replace the existing
<code>.nah_xcode_uncrustify.cfg</code> (which you also want to do).</p>

<p>As with manual editing, if it all goes wrong you can delete
<code>.nah_xcode_uncrustify.cfg</code> from your home folder then re-reun the
uncrustifying Behavior to recreate the default config.</p>

<h2>Script Miscellanea</h2>

<p><code>nah_xcode_uncrustify.rb</code> has peculiarities.</p>

<p>It only tries to format C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++ and header files
(<code>*.h</code>).</p>

<p>What the script considers to be the main source folder depends on the name of
the project. If the project is called <code>Bob</code>, then the main source folder is
assumed to be called <code>Bob</code>, and is inside the same folder containing
<code>Bob.xcodeproj</code>. This allows you to place third party submodules outside of
that folder, preventing the script from reformatting them. This is especially
important for <code>git</code> users as modifying <code>git submodule</code> folders can cause
issues for other people trying to checkout the code.</p>

<p>The script tries to be clever about the language type of header files.
Objective-C, Objective-C++, C and C++ all happily use <code>*.h</code> files as header
files. The script will search for a source file with the same name as the
header file and use that extension as the language setting for the header. At
the moment, it searches the main source folder for the associated source file.
If it can't find one it treats it as an Objective-C header file on the
assumption that it's probably a protocol.</p>

<p>The default formatting for C and C++ files may be a bit shonky and
inconsistent compared to Objective-C files. I spend most of my time in
Objective-C land these days, so didn't have many test files handy.</p>

<p>Shuffling is just like buses. You sit about being deterministic for years, and
then all of a sudden, you need some random shuffling on two platforms at once.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As a follow on from my previous post on <a href="/blog/2011/08/shuffling-arrays/">shuffling AS3 arrays</a>,
here's the same algorithm implemented as a category addition to
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSMutableArray_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSMutableArray</a>
for all your easy array shuffling needs.</p>

<p>To use it, download the method and header files, add them to your project and
them simply include the header file wherever you you want to shuffle anNSMutableArray:</p>
